Radiant Gear is a mod that acts as a simple compatibility bridge between [Curios API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios)
or [Trinkets API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets) and dynamic light mods. With this mod, items in
accessory slots will inherit the dynamic lighting behavior defined by the dynamic lighting mod. As an example, if a held
torch would provide dynamic lighting, then installing this mod will cause torches placed in accessory slots to also
provide dynamic lighting.

**Please note: This mod does NOT add any content or slots on its own. In order to gain more slots or assign items into
slots, users will need to either add a mod that adds that kind of content or add it themselves.**

* [Trinkets API Configuration](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide)

**Compatible Mods**
- [Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-lights)
- [Lucent](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lucent)
- [Magnesium/Rubidium Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamiclights-reforged)
- [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau)
- [LambDynamicLights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lambdynamiclights)

Note: This mod's sidedness depends on the dynamic lighting mod used. For example, if using Lucent then this mod is
client-side only because Lucent is client-side only. On the other hand, if using Dynamic Lights then this mod is
required on both client and server because Dynamic Lights is required on both as well.
